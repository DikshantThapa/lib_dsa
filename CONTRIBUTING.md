## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Here are some best practices to follow when contributing to the library:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
- Write clear and concise commit messages
- Write clean, well-documented, and well-tested code that adheres to the project's coding conventions
- Ensure that all tests pass before submitting your changes
- Update the relevant documentation as necessary
- Submit a pull request and include a detailed description of your changes

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that your changes are in line with the project's goals and that they do not introduce any breaking changes.

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/ItsAash/lib_dsa/issues/issues) to track bugs and feature requests, so please check the Issues page to see if your contribution has already been requested or if there are any open issues that you can help with.

### Note on Naming Conventions

When contributing to this library, please follow the following naming conventions:

- Use camel case when naming functions, variables, and classes. We follow the standard naming conventions for JavaScript, where the first word is in lowercase and subsequent words are capitalized. For example, `functionName`, `variableName`, and `ClassName`.

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions. Names should be self-explanatory and make it easy for others to understand what the code does.

- Use all caps when defining constants. Constants are variables whose values should not be changed during runtime. For example, `const PI = 3.14159`.

- Use underscore prefixes for private variables and functions. Private variables and functions are those that should not be accessed from outside their containing module or class. Prefixing their names with an underscore helps to indicate their privacy. For example, `_privateVariable` and `_privateFunction()`.

Using consistent naming conventions makes the code more readable, understandable, and maintainable, so we appreciate your cooperation in following these conventions. Thank you!
