# lib_dsa

Welcome to lib_dsa! This is a library for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that provides a collection of usable components and code snippets.

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to serve as a resource for developers who are interested in learning or improving their understanding of DSA. It provides a collection of well-documented, reusable components that can be used as building blocks in larger projects or as learning resources for specific DSA concepts.

## Contents

The library is organized into the following directories:

- `algorithms`: contains implementations of popular DSA algorithms, such as sorting and searching algorithms.
- `data-structures`: contains implementations of popular DSA data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and trees.
- `utils`: contains utility functions and helper classes that are used across the library.

## Getting started

To get started with using the library, you can clone this repository and include the necessary files in your project. Each directory has its own README.md file with instructions on how to use the components within it.

### Documentation

- Write clear and concise documentation for all functions and modules. Documentation should include information on function parameters, return values, and any side effects.

- Use JSDoc comments to annotate functions and modules with their expected input and output types.

Using consistent naming conventions, code formatting, testing, and documentation practices makes the codebase more readable, understandable, and maintainable, and helps ensure that the library functions as intended. Thank you for your cooperation in following these practices!
